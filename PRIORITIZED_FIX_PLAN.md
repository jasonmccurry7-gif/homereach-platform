# Prioritized Fix Plan

Updated: 2026-05-24

## CRITICAL

### GitHub PR Creation Blocker

What is wrong: GitHub CLI is installed but not authenticated in this shell.

Why it matters: The validated branch has been pushed, but this shell cannot create the PR through `gh pr create`.

Files: none.

Safest fix: authenticate `gh`, then open the PR; alternatively open the pushed branch through GitHub's compare URL.

Risk of fix: low.

Approval needed: no production approval; account authentication required.

## HIGH

### Lint Warning Debt

What is wrong: `apps/web` linting now runs through ESLint CLI, but it reports 506 warnings.

Why it matters: warnings include unused variables, unescaped text, legacy `any` usage, direct anchor navigation, and hook dependency issues that can hide real defects over time.

Files:

- `apps/web/package.json`
- `apps/web/eslint.config.mjs`
- many `apps/web/app/**` and `apps/web/lib/**` modules

Safest fix: reduce warnings in focused passes by module, starting with revenue-critical intake, dashboard, and webhook-adjacent code.

Risk of fix: low to medium depending on module touched.

Approval needed: no for isolated cleanup; yes before touching protected revenue logic behavior.

### Build Skips Type And Lint Validation

What is wrong: `apps/web/next.config.ts` has `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors=true` and `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds=true`.

Why it matters: Next build can pass even when typecheck/lint are broken.

Files:

- `apps/web/next.config.ts`

Safest fix: keep explicit `turbo type-check --ui=stream` as the release gate now; remove build ignores only after lint is fixed.

Risk of fix: medium; flipping both immediately could block deployment due lint drift.

Approval needed: no, but should be sequenced after lint repair.

### New AI/Political/Procurement Modules Need Workflow QA

What is wrong: current main includes large new systems that passed compile/build/route smoke but not full workflow validation.

Why it matters: these systems touch executive workflows, political planning, AI orchestration, and procurement positioning.

Files:

- `apps/web/lib/ai-orchestration/*`
- `apps/web/app/political/*`
- `apps/web/lib/political/*`
- `apps/web/app/inventory-purchasing/*`
- `apps/web/lib/gov-contracts/*`

Safest fix: run module-level read-only QA first, then test mutations in dry-run/test mode.

Risk of fix: low for audit; medium for mutation validation.

Approval needed: provider-mutating tests require explicit test-mode controls.

## MEDIUM

### Political Launch Depends On Feature Flag

What is wrong: `/political/*` intentionally returns `404` unless `ENABLE_POLITICAL=true`.

Why it matters: production visibility depends on Vercel env configuration.

Files:

- `apps/web/lib/political/env.ts`
- Vercel environment

Safest fix: decide whether political should be public in production, then set `ENABLE_POLITICAL` accordingly.

Risk of fix: low.

Approval needed: business/product approval recommended before public launch.

### Temporary Patch Artifacts Exist Locally

What is wrong: two local patch reference files exist in the current worktree.

Why it matters: they are useful for rollback/reference but should not be committed.

Files:

- `PORT_VALIDATED_TYPEFIXES_20260524.patch`
- `REFERENCE_STABILIZATION_CANDIDATE_DIFF_20260524.patch`

Safest fix: leave untracked or move to an ignored local notes area before final PR.

Risk of fix: low.

Approval needed: no.

## LOW

### Turbo Defaults To TUI

What is wrong: `turbo.json` uses `ui: "tui"`, which can hang in this shell.

Why it matters: local command reliability is worse on Windows/Codex shell.

Files:

- `turbo.json`

Safest fix: use `pnpm exec turbo type-check --ui=stream` for validation, or change project default to stream if CI/local consistency is preferred.

Risk of fix: low.

Approval needed: no.
