# Daily Executive Report

Date: 2026-05-25

## Completed Work

- Confirmed the current stabilization PR branch is clean except for two intentionally untracked local reference patch files.
- Confirmed GitHub CLI is still not authenticated in this shell; the GitHub connector remains usable.
- Created `PROVIDER_FLOW_AUDIT.md` covering Stripe, Supabase, Twilio, email providers, webhooks, and deployment validation posture.
- Promoted provider risks into `PRIORITIZED_FIX_PLAN.md`.
- Hardened `apps/web/lib/supabase/service.ts` so missing service env fails clearly before creating a Supabase service-role client.
- Repaired Stripe webhook idempotency so fresh in-flight `received` duplicates return retryable 409 instead of false-success 200.
- Added focused Stripe idempotency unit tests.
- Hardened targeted route checkout so public payment links no longer trust a bare campaign UUID.
- Added signed targeted checkout tokens, a legacy customer-email confirmation fallback, add-on allowlisting, and the production env requirement/template entries for `TARGETED_CHECKOUT_SIGNING_SECRET`.
- Hardened Twilio status webhook persistence by switching the post-signature append-only insert to the Supabase service-role client.
- Hardened Postmark webhook handling so email event insert failures return retryable 503 and delivery events cannot clear suppression states.
- Added provider telemetry freshness warnings to the admin outreach health endpoint.
- Added the targeted checkout signing secret placeholder to GitHub Actions build env so CI validates the production env gate intentionally.
- Confirmed `TARGETED_CHECKOUT_SIGNING_SECRET` is now configured in Vercel production and in the branch preview environment for `codex/current-main-audit-20260524`; values were not printed.
- Added synthetic Stripe webhook signature verification tests using Stripe SDK test headers; no Stripe API calls, charges, or provider events were created.
- Added provider-shaped Twilio status and Postmark webhook sample-payload tests without live sends, live provider calls, charges, or production data mutation.
- Pushed provider audit documentation to the draft PR.

## Validation

- Local focused Stripe idempotency test: passed, 7 tests.
- Local focused Stripe webhook signature test: passed, 3 tests.
- Local focused targeted checkout token test: passed, 7 tests.
- Local focused Postmark webhook helper test: passed, 7 tests.
- Local focused Twilio status webhook helper test: passed, 5 tests.
- Local focused provider telemetry health test: passed, 5 tests.
- Local `pnpm test`: passed, 130 tests.
- Local `pnpm exec turbo type-check --ui=stream`: passed, 5 packages.
- Local `pnpm --filter @homereach/web lint`: passed with existing warning debt.
- Local `pnpm --filter @homereach/web build`: passed with non-secret placeholder env.
- Local browser smoke on targeted checkout: passed. No-token checkout links show email confirmation and disable Pay; token-bearing links skip the email prompt and enable Pay.
- Remote GitHub Actions `Validate` run #10 for commit `7ab5d0c`: passed.
- Remote Vercel deployment for commit `7ab5d0c`: failed before the Vercel project env repair because `TARGETED_CHECKOUT_SIGNING_SECRET` was missing at build time. A fresh deployment is needed after the env repair.
- Remote GitHub Actions `Validate` run #11 for commit `2d525aa`: passed.
- Remote Vercel deployment for commit `2d525aa`: passed after the Vercel project env repair.
- Remote GitHub Actions `Validate` run #12 for commit `e3adc7a`: passed.
- Remote Vercel deployment for commit `e3adc7a`: passed after the provider sample-payload test layer.

## Revenue And Reliability Risks

- Medium: targeted checkout billing copy references ongoing monthly billing while Stripe uses one-time `payment` mode.
- Medium: main bundle checkout still routes monthly-priced bundle purchases through one-time payment mode.
- Deployment gate: Vercel production and the branch preview now have `TARGETED_CHECKOUT_SIGNING_SECRET`; the repaired branch-preview build passed for commit `2d525aa`.

## Production Readiness Status

Current status: stabilization branch is local-build, GitHub-Actions, and Vercel-preview ready, but provider-live promotion is not ready.

Reason: payment webhook retry behavior, targeted checkout authorization, Twilio status persistence, Postmark callback durability, and provider telemetry freshness now have tested branch fixes. Stripe has synthetic signature coverage, and Twilio/Postmark have local provider-shaped sample-payload coverage, but Stripe/Twilio/email test-mode validation against isolated provider tooling still needs completion.

## Recommended Next Actions

1. Push the synthetic provider-validation layer and confirm hosted checks again.
2. Decide whether targeted checkout monthly add-ons should be copy-only, first-month setup, or true subscriptions.
3. Validate Stripe webhook behavior with Stripe CLI/test-mode against isolated data.
4. Validate Twilio and Postmark webhook endpoints with local tunnel or provider test tools, still with no mass sends and no production data mutation.
5. Review monthly-billing intent before changing any Stripe mode or subscription behavior.
